    At runtime, it still defaults to urg_node as the graph
    name

ros-rolling-urg-node (0.1.11-2focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Add support for URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode
    The urg_node does not support SCIP 1.1. The Hokuyo URG-04LX supports both
    SCIP 1.1 and SCIP 2.0, but needs to be switched to SCIP 2.0 at every startup
    in its default configuration. For this purpose the function
    URGCWrapper::setToSCIP2() was added.
    A URG-04LX in SCIP 1.1 mode used to lead to an exception being thrown in
    URGCwrapper::initialize. Now, before throwing the exception an attempt to
    switch the sensor to SCIP 2.0 is made.
  * Fixed comments in launch file and added roslaunch.
  * Add flag to prevent updating of detailed status.
    If using a model that does not support AR00 command, hide it
    behind a rosparam.
  * Add safety stop heading and distance values (#28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/urg_node/issues/28>)
    Added to the laser status field the last report of a safety
    stop of distance and angle reported. If this fails or is unavailable
    it will just report 0.
  * Updating depend and roslint.
    Fixing some roslint error after moving a header name.
    Additionally fixing the gencfg to be on the lib and not the node.
  * Adding missing std_srvs depend.
    Adding missing std_srvs depend to package.xml and CMakelists.txt
  * Move urg_node to be a library.
    Moving urg_node to urg_node_driver as a library.
    This allows for other nodes to include this as an object instead
    of spawning another separate process.
  * Add getAR00 status command.
    Added ability to pull the status of the lidar AR00 status command.
    This then publishes a latched topic with the current status of the
    lidar's error code and lockout status.
  * Update urg_node to be a self contained class
    Updating urg node to be a self contained class. This allows
    for it to be imported in other nodes.
  * Roslint
